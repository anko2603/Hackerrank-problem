#VGiven an array of stick lengths, use  of them to construct a non-degenerate triangle with the maximum possible perimeter. 
# Return an array of the lengths of its sides as 3 integers in non-decreasing order.If there are several valid triangles having the 
# maximum perimeter:Choose the one with the longest maximum side.If more than one has that maximum, choose from them the one with the 
# longest minimum side.If more than one has that maximum as well, print any one them.If no non-degenerate triangle exists, return[-1] .
