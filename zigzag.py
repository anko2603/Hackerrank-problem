#In this challenge, the task is to debug the existing code to successfully execute all provided test files.Given an array 
# of n distinct integers, transform the array into a zig zag sequence by permuting the array elements. A sequence will be 
# called a zig zag sequence if the first k elements in the sequence are in increasing order and the last k  elements are in 
# decreasing order, where k=(n+1)/2 . You need to find the lexicographically smallest zig zag sequence of the given array.
